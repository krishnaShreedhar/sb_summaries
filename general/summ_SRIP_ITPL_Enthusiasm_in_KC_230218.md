Enthusiasm_in_KC

*SB 7.4.37*
*Translation: From the very beginning of his childhood, Prahlāda Mahārāja was uninterested in childish playthings. Indeed, he gave them up altogether and remained silent and dull, being fully absorbed in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Since his mind was always affected by Kṛṣṇa consciousness, he could not understand how the world goes on being fully absorbed in the activities of sense gratification.*
1. Appointment with Manager in ABP company in WTC, Bengaluru. Everybody was enthused to start their work in the morning. For acheiving progress in any field/activities of life, we need to be Enthusiastic.
2. Enthion - One who is influenced by Godly force.
3. Prahlāda Mahārāja - why is he an exalted personality even if he is a small boy? He was appearing very dull externally but his mind was fully absorbed in the thoughts of Krishna. A metaphor is used: under the strong influence of the planet called as Krishna.
4. For a materialistic person get bewildered seeing devotees thinking they are gone crazy. And on the other side devotees think that materialistic people are crazy because they are working so hard for the flickering sense enjoyment.

    *2. Remember that Krishna is a Person*. Do what pleases him the most by putting all the efforts amidst all the difficulties. Intense Eagerness
    *3. Take up some menial service* when you lose Enthusiasm. In the association of devotees, you can hear the glories of the service of devotees
    *4. Share with others.* Philosophy/Prashadam/KC quotes/Realization/SP Books
    *5. Maintain a journal.* How Krishna helped you today? What all you can thank Krishna for?
9. Krishna is just waiting for our love. Everything else is given to us by him only. Hence we should offer our offerings with love and devotion.
10. How to realize Krishna's love? By association of devotees and by doing devotional service.
