*AAP_HKM_MUM_break_bad_and_build_good_habits*

1. We all have many habits. Some good and some bad. Following are some key points to note about habits:
    1. A character of any person is the sum total of his habits. 
    2. Good habits are the key to all success. 
    3. Bad habits unlock the door to failure.
    4. We may develop habits unintentionally. 
    5. First we form the habits and then the habits reform you and so on.
    6. Conquer your bad habits or they'll eventually conquer you. 
    7. To change your Life and lead a Legacy, change your Habits.
2. Four quadrants of Time management from the book 7 Habits of effective people.
    1. Quadrant 1: Important and Urgent 2. Quadrant 2: Important and Not Urgent
    3. Quadrant 3: Not Important and Urgent 4. Quadrant 4: Not Important and Not Urgent
3. Most of the times, People tend to act impulsively even though it may or may not be important
    and don't do plan activities. Examples of urgent:
    1. Nature's call (imp)
    2. Submission deadlines (imp)
    3. A notification from some social media app (not imp) - temptation
4. We spend a lot of time in urgent activities due to circumstances. 
    1. Activity that is important but not urgent: meditation, exercise, studying Bhagavad-gita.
    2. Intelligent people spend a lot of time in such activities. Proactively these activities
    should be undertaken: Prevention, Planning and Improvement
5. Not important and not urgent: e.g. watching TV mindlessly. useless activities.
6. Building Habits is a Quadrant 2 activity. In book of Power of Habits: Habit Loop. e.g. Pepsodent ad:
    Came up with an innovative ad, then you'll have gush of freshness and sparkling white teeth. Reward.
    We want that feel good again and we develop a craving to brush our teeth. When done again and again,
    you'll feel something is missing if you don't brush teeth. Habit.
7. *Habit Loop: Cue -> Action -> Reward -> Cue -> ... infinite cycle* 
8. Bad habits don't disappear miraculously. You need to work on it and break the cycle.
    Activity: Big Krishna - Small Krishna with opposite action and words than of the picture.
9. Mind is hard wired to do single-tasking with Excellence. When we try to change many things at a time,
    it is very difficult to keep up with the changes. Feeling of missing something would jump in 
    and we may quit. On top of that we have a lot of instructions.
10. FOCUS: Focus one course until successful. How many days does it take to instill a habit? 21 days? Nope. 
    Average time for habit formation: 66 days. Opportunity to change habits 3-5 forever.
    So, in one year we have 5 units of 70 days! We should focus only on one habit. 
    It is equally difficult to instill/break a good habit too. So, once we install it successfully, 
    we can focus on another habit. 
11. Any goal/habit we need 3 things: 
    1. Jnana: Knowledge - Pros and cons of our actions, the cycle of habit, etc.
    2. Bala: Strength - Knowing and doing should be filled in using strength. 
        To overcome lethargy. This is where we need Lord's help. We can do wonders.
        But those who worship Me with devotion, meditating on My transcendental form-
        to them I carry what they lack and preserve what they have. [BG 9.22]
        I am seated in everyone’s heart, and from Me come remembrance, knowledge and forgetfulness. 
        By all the Vedas am I to be known; indeed I am the compiler of Vedānta, 
        and I am the knower of the Vedas. [BG 15.15]
    3. Kriya: Actions - Skills/tools/techniques for taking appropriate action.
12. When does Lord help? It is when we develop a relationship with the Lord. Invested more and 
    more time and energy in relationship with people. If we want his guidance, then we need to invest time. 
    *If you pray only when in trouble, then you are in trouble.* 
13. Confidence that God is great. You won't have anything to lose or gain or pride because you know 
    who is the actual doer. *God's strength is greater than my weakness.*
14. mac-cittah sarva-durgani mat-prasadat tarisyasi [BG 18.58] If you become conscious of Me, you will 
    pass over all the obstacles of conditional life by My grace. If, however, you do not work in such 
    consciousness but act through false ego, not hearing Me, you will be lost.
    e.g. story of father - daughter - heavy log in the road - tried only on her own strength - 
    all strength was to take help from father also.
15. If we are not trained properly, we act impulsively without any thought. When we have wisdom and 
    controlled mind, we have a power to choose and we can give an intelligent response to the stimulus.
    Mastering yourself is true power. Building new habits is an internal work and not focussing on 
    external people and circumstances. If you correct your mind, then the rest of the life is a piece of cake.
16. abhinatvam nama-namino. Lord and His holy names are non-different. He is the Absolute Truth. 
    Simple way to connect with Lord is to chant His holy names attentively.
