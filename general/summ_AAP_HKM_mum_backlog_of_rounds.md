1. *Case study:* Deepti has a taken a vow to chant 8 rounds regularly. She used to chant 8 rounds in the morning
    before doing any chores. Gradually, she split the rounds to do 4 in the morning and 4 later in the daytime.
    Soon, she started feeling it difficult to complete her rounds. She started doing lesser rounds and the 
    backlog kept growing for the next day, until one day she decided to stop chanting. 
    How can we help Deepti with her chanting process?
2. Initially we should do it as though we are bound by some unbreakable rules and regulations. Even though we may
    feel extreme drag or disinterested in doing it just for the sake of it. Be consistent with the number of rounds
    and perpetually strive to improve the quality of rounds. Stick to the commitment even if you're feeling utmost 
    discomfort or feeling tasteless or mechanical or meaningless etc and continuously strive to improve.
3. *Suggestion 1:* Chanting while doing something else? 
    Ideal chanting is to do it attentively without any distractions. 
    But if you're unable to find time to chant, then better is to do at least a few rounds than nothing.
    You may chant while doing some other activities which don't require much attention like walking, 
    doing some chores, etc. 
4. *Suggestion 2: Reduce the rounds?*
    1. Let's say one wants to do 8 rounds daily. Then one may get an idea that instead of struggling to do 8 rounds,
        why not chant 4 rounds attentively. Then it may happen that you'll feel tired of chanting even 4 rounds and 
        you may get another idea that Lord needs love and devotion and not some number of rounds, so why not 
        chant 1 round with devotion. But ultimately, you'll fall in the vicious cycle of the mind and never take 
        out time for chanting.
    2. We should remind ourselves the purpose of Chanting when we started and do not lose hope and somehow or the 
        other, keep chanting and continuously strive to chant better by planning efficiently.
5. *Food for thought:* Let's say there are two buildings A and B. There is a thick and strong 500m rod connecting 
    the 80th floors of the respective buildings. There's a deep pit below the rod. If someone offers you 1 million USD, 
    would you take the chance of crossing over the rod from A to B?
    1. Some may take or some may not. But the answer is based on the VALUE system of the person. Life is more 
        precious than 1 million USD.
    2. Instead of money, if there were your loved one who is under deep trouble, we may choose to risk our life to 
        help the person we love. Because, we may value that person more than our life.
    3. LEARNING: We all have our own VALUE hierarchy. When we are unable to find time for Chanting, then we can clearly
        understand that Chanting is at the bottom of our value system. It's as good as, I'll finish doing 
        everything else and if time permits then I'll spend some time chanting.
6. *The goal of Life is to make Chanting as the topmost priority!*
    *How to increase the value of Chanting?* Constant cycle of reading (studying) and chanting! 
7. *Use the morning time very effectively.* Robin Sharma talks about The 5 AM Club in most of his books. It is time
    to understand the value of the morning routines to be successful, be it in spiritual life or material. Even CEO,
    and top executive performers follow this religiously.
8. *Suyantritau* Srila Prabhupada says that our life should be extremely Disciplined like a Machine but not mechanical.
9. Reducing the number of rounds is not a good idea, because subconsciously we may even lose faith on ourselves that
    I took a commitment to chant 8 rounds and I broke it. This shows that we failed to keep up to our commitment.
    *Trust bank:* When we make a resolution and we fulfil it then we make an increment in our trust bank (self-esteem)
    and when fail to meet a resolution then we make a withdrawal from the trust bank, which reduces our strength.
    The necessary WILLPOWER will be exercised and you can achieve better goals in your day to day lives. This makes 
    us immune to the varied circumstances and help us sustain on our disciplined path.
