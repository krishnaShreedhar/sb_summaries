*VAKP_Lord_Chaitanya_4_2_imp_verses_240520*
*These are the 2 verses that Lord Chaitanya wants us all to memorize.*

1. Chaitanya Mahaprabhu learnt from His spiritual master Ishwar Puri. He was told keep in his throat, i.e. be there with you always. *"nama vinu kali kale nahi aara dharma | sarva mantra saara naam yei shastra marma ||"* Instruction 2: "eta boli ek shloka shikhaila more, kanthe koriya yei shloka koriho vichar" Mantra:
"harer nāma harer nāma harer nāmaiva kevalam | kalau nāsty eva nāsty eva nāsty eva gatir anyathā ||" [Cc. Ādi 7.76]
2. Repetition 3 times! Why? To stress its importance. It's the ultimate thing for everybody. To take it very very seriously. Kevalam means NO other process. It is a *"certainly"* no other way. Pray to Krishna that to remember His holy name always.
3. Second verse, We should have this verse around our neck: Third verse of Shikshashtakam 3
*"tṛṇād api sunīcena taror api sahiṣṇunā amāninā mānadena kīrtanīyaḥ sadā hariḥ"*
4. The very fact that it is coming again and again should remind us that this is very very important to pay attention to it.
5. "urdhva bahu kori kaho shuno sarva loka"--- Remember to chant always and also to remember the mood in which to chant. Grass is used to show extreme humility. People trample over it for no fault of the grass. It doesn't gets affected by the various disturbances.
6. One should be more tolerant than the tree. *4 practical lessons from a tree*:
  a. Anyone and everyone plucks the fruits of the tree (*belongings taken away*) and it tolerates
  b. Torrents of rain and thunder and natural calamities, but the tree *never complaints* and provides shelter for others
  c. If somebody cuts and hurts a tree, it'll *not protest*. e.g. Haridasa Thakur.
  d. Even the tree is drying up, the tree is *not even requesting* for water.
7. Giving all respects to everyone - all living entities. Maana promotes the bodily concept of Life and it is all material. Real glory belongs to the spiritual master. *Try: Ignore all disrespects and respect everyone and check for yourself the peacefulness in your heart. And you can chant the holy name easily and always.*
8. Pastime of Srila Prabhupada: 1930, Allahabad: - Associate with devotees of Rupa Gaudiya Math - Recollection by godbrother Dr. OBL Kapoor - Exchange philosophical discussions and kirtans - Tonic given by Srila Prabhuada - Tonic of Love of Godhead - Request for another tonic -  Prabhupada said "I don't have it, but I have the formula..." and Prabhupada quotes the Shikshashtakam verse 3. This was Prabhupada's thinking all the way along. "bhakti nahi veda nahi name bado daar bhaktivedanta naam ebe sarthak kar" He was the pinnacle of Bhakti and Knowledge but Srila Prabhupada had deep humility.
9. Dr. OBL Kapoor met Srila Prabhuada again after about 40 years - Prabhupada was still as humble as he was before.
