1. Krishna was mischievious. He would perform His activities to give pleasure to the devotees. *His activities are advertisements of spiritual world.* One such lila is the cause of bewilderment for mother Yashoda.
2. Cowherd boys went and complained to mother Yashoda that Krishna ate mud. Even Lord Balaram supported the accusation and hence, Mother Yashoda gets very anxious. When she came to check upon Krishna, she made him open his mouth and she saw the Entire Universe in His mouth. She saw many things in His mouth which is described in Krishna book.
3. Mother Yashoda started to develop the mood of awe and reverence. Krishna immediated called for Yogamaya to make mother Yashoda forgetful of this event. Krishna loves to be bound by the love of His devotees rather than be worshipped in awe and reverence.
4. Important learnings: In Vrindavan, everybody's consciousness is to *not lose any opportunity to serve Krishna.* Srila Prabhupada has given us the Matchless gift of Krishna Consciousness. We should do everything to make sure I progress well in Krishna Consciousness. Attitude of mother Yashoda: that we should be watchful and careful of the pitfalls that can take Krishna away from me. Activity: Make a note for yourself about your possible pitfalls/challenges. for e.g. oversleeping, bad association.
5. Vrindavan is a Chintamani dham. Whatever you desire gets fulfilled. So also be careful of what you think and desire.
6. Mahotsaha Chaitanya Prabhu also described the pastime of Bhuteshwar Mahadev in short.
