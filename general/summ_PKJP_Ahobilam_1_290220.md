1. Parikshit Maharaj is asking Sukadev Goswami, *"Why is Lord Vishnu partial to devatas?"* Answer: Whatever Lord does is Absolutely Good - it is not on material plane. e.g. Krishna's mercifully gave liberation to Shishupala.
2. "how can some father be so cruel on his saintly child?" Hiranyakashipu and Prahlada's story. Even Hiranyakashipu was well-versed with the scriptures. 7th canto is divided in 16 scenes. This pastime is very sweet and can be remembered always. Prayers of Prahlada Maharaj to pacified Lord Narsimhadeva when even prayers of other exhalted devotees couldn't.
3. This world is temporary. Musafirkhana. We visit this world to achieve a purpose and go back home BackToGodHead!
4. *If you understand the science of God, what should we do?* Follow in the foosteps of Mahajanas. No arguments, No vedic literatures, No munis, dharmasya tattvam is deeply rooted in Mahajanas' heart. So, you could simply follow.
5. Prahlada Maharaj was feeling really low and unqualified to pacify the Lord. Every pure devotee feels that he is the most sinful person. Jagai and Madhai used to use Manu samhita as checklist to commit sins. Krishnadas Kaviraj Goswami was thinking he is more sinful than Jagai and Madhai but actually he was so exhalted.
6. trinad api sunichena taror iva sahishnuna - Shikshashtakam verse 3. If we practice this then we'll be able to chant nicely. We should start appreciating things rather than finding faults and complaining. Give respect and keep chanting.
7. Lord Krishna is Supreme is all qualities. material qualities won't be able to attract Krishna because He is more qualified than us. We are infinitesimal. However, Krishna doesn't have bhakti (love and devotional service). Hence, we can attract and even control Krishna by bhakti.
8. *Become humble to Chant and Chant to become humble*.
9. *bhaktyā tutoṣa bhagavān gaja-yūtha-pāya - SB 7.9.9*
10. Brahmana's qualities - intelligent, truth, tolerant, not envious, performs sacrifices, Austerity. If chandala is a devotee of Krishna, he is far above than a Brahmana who is not a devotee. A devotee can liberate generations of his family, just by his devotion.
11. Lakshmi Narsimhadeva temple - pastime of Lord Chaitanya: Kolvecha Shridhara - He was very poor and his hut's ceiling used to leak.He used to sell Banana leaves. He used to offer 50 percent of his earning for Ganga puja. Even being so poor, he was content that at least he has a shelter and animals don't even have that. He prays for eternal devotional service when Lord ordered him to ask for a boon.
12. Krishna is atmarama. The offering of Devotional service is beneficial for devotees and not for Krishna. We should offer with heart-felt love and devotion.
13. Karanja Narsimhadeva - Hanuman was meditating on Lord Rama in Narsimha kshetra and hence, Lord Rama came in the form of Narsimha with his bow and arrow and gave darshan to Hanuman.
