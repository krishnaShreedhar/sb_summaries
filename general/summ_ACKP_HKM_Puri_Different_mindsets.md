*ACKP_HKM_Puri_Different_mindsets*

1. The Law is taken as the basis for any arguments. Similarly, we should take scriptures 
    as the law for any philosophical discussions. There should be evidence from shastras.
2. *How many categories of people? Only 2.* Divine and Demoniac as described in Chapter 16 of Bhagavad-gita.
3. Qualities of Divine people are men described in the verses BG 16.1-3. and similarly for Demoniac in BG 16.4.
4. Divine qualities liberate you and demoniac qualities put you in bondage. We are forced to act under the 
    influence of the 3 modes of material nature: goodness, passion, and ignorance.
5. *Why is any person forced to do sinful activities?* To which Lord answers in BG 3.37 "It is lust only, 
    Arjuna, which is born of contact with the material modes of passion and later transformed into wrath, 
    and which is the all-devouring, sinful enemy of this world."
6. *How to deal with people of different mindsets?* With compassion. Story of the snake disciple of Narada muni.
    "Not to bite unnecessarily but defend yourself without harming" We should focus on our duties. 
    If somebody is angry then you find the cause and try to mitigate. If without reason somebody wants to 
    cause harm then better to stay far away. If somebody is ready to listen then try to help them.
