*ACKP_HKM_Puri_Different_mindsets*

1. The Law is taken as the basis for any arguments. Similarly, we should take scriptures 
    as the law for any philosophical discussions. There should be evidence from shastras.
2. *How many categories of people? Only 2.* Divine and Demoniac as described in Chapter 16 of Bhagavad-gita.
3. Qualities of Divine people are men described in the verses BG 16.1-3. and similarly for Demoniac in BG 16.4.
4. Divine qualities liberate you and demoniac qualities put you in bondage. We are forced to act under the 
    influence of the 3 modes of material nature: goodness, passion, and ignorance.
5. *Why is any person forced to do sinful activities?* To which Lord answers in BG 3.37 "It is lust only, 
    Arjuna, which is born of contact with the material modes of passion and later transformed into wrath, 
    and which is the all-devouring, sinful enemy of this world."
6. *How to deal with people of different mindsets?* With compassion. Story of the snake disciple of Narada muni.
    "Not to bite unnecessarily but defend yourself without harming" We should focus on our duties. 
    If somebody is angry then you find the cause and try to mitigate. If without reason somebody wants to 
    cause harm then better to stay far away. If somebody is ready to listen then try to help them.
7. There is no end for greedy person's desires. One cannot come out of lusty desires by engaging 
    into such activities. We should deal with anger properly.
8. A person who is very faithfully engaged in the worship of the Deity in the temple but does not know how 
    to behave toward devotees or people in general is called a prākṛta-bhakta, or kaniṣṭha-adhikārī. 
    [SB 11.2.47]
9. Prahlada Maharaj so innocent and humble, that he could attract the Supreme Lord. When one is advanced in the 
    consciousness, he doesn't want anything from the Lord, but simply wants devotion and has compassion for 
    all the living entities. A devotee only does good to others.
10. Formula for world peace is given in BG 5.29: A person in full consciousness of Me, knowing Me to be the ultimate 
    beneficiary of all sacrifices and austerities, the Supreme Lord of all planets and demigods, and the benefactor 
    and well-wisher of all living entities, attains peace from the pangs of material miseries.
    "bhoktāraṁ yajña-tapasāṁ sarva-loka-maheśvaram | 
    suhṛdaṁ sarva-bhūtānāṁ jñātvā māṁ śāntim ṛcchati ||"
11. When Krishna is made the center of all activities, then all the situations could be dealt peacefully.
