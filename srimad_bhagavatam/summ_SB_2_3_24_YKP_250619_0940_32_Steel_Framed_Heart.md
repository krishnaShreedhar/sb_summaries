*SB_2_3_24_YKP_250619_0940_32_Steel_Framed_Heart*

*Translation for SB 2.3.24*: Certainly that heart is steel-framed which, in spite of one's chanting the holy name 
of the Lord with concentration, does not change when ecstasy takes place, tears fill the eyes and 
the hairs stand on end.

1. Shaunak muni is telling: "After receiving the mercy of the devotees of the Lord, the devotion for 
    Lord Krishna would increase and lead you to the stage of bhava gradually."
2. If reaction does not take place even though sadhana is done meticulously, it may be considered due to 
    offenses only. A complete progressive march on the return path home, back to Godhead, will depend on 
    the instructions of the revealed scriptures directed by a realized devotee. One should not invent one's own 
    path of devotion which is not aligned with devotees' instructions.
3. Regulated Devotional service - *vidhi bhakti. Two divisions: 1. Executive and 2. Effective*
    Executive is sadhana, repeated performance of devotional activities like Chanting. This leads to the 
    bhava bhakti stage. Raganuga bhakti - Spontaneous devotional service.
4. Bhava means ecstatic symptoms of love of GodHead are manifested. After appearing externally, these symptoms 
    continue to stay in the mind of the devotee and further enhance the exchanges of loving affairs with Krishna. 
    *This stage of bhava or ecstacy can be attained in 2 ways: 1. Constant association with pure devotees
    2. By special and causeless mercy of Krishna or pure devotees (rare)*
5. *By the mercy of Narada muni, Prahlada Maharaj* could take advantage of his instructions by his special blessings 
    and wishes that the child should *become a pure devotee*. But generally, one should execute sadhana 
    (devotional service) very rigidly so that it can elevate us gradually.
6. If the natural symptoms of bhakti are not appearing, then we should understand that we are disobeying 
    the instructions and not following the acharyas properly. Such a heart is called as steel-framed otherwise our 
    heart would be drenched in the love of Krishna.
7. We should meticulously avoid all the 10 offenses while Chanting the holy names of the Lord.
