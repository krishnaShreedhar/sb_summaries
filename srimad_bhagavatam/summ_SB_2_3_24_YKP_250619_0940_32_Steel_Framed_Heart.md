*SB_2_3_24_YKP_250619_0940_32_Steel_Framed_Heart*

*Translation for SB 2.3.24*: Certainly that heart is steel-framed which, in spite of one's chanting the holy name 
of the Lord with concentration, does not change when ecstasy takes place, tears fill the eyes and 
the hairs stand on end.

1. Shaunak muni is telling: "After receiving the mercy of the devotees of the Lord, the devotion for 
    Lord Krishna would increase and lead you to the stage of bhava gradually."
2. If reaction does not take place even though sadhana is done meticulously, it may be considered due to 
    offenses only. A complete progressive march on the return path home, back to Godhead, will depend on 
    the instructions of the revealed scriptures directed by a realized devotee. One should not invent one's own 
    path of devotion which is not aligned with devotees' instructions.
3. Regulated Devotional service - *vidhi bhakti. Two divisions: 1. Executive and 2. Effective*
    Executive is sadhana, repeated performance of devotional activities like Chanting. This leads to the 
    bhava bhakti stage. Raganuga bhakti - Spontaneous devotional service.
4. Bhava means ecstatic symptoms of love of GodHead are manifested. After appearing externally, these symptoms 
    continue to stay in the mind of the devotee and further enhance the exchanges of loving affairs with Krishna. 
    *This stage of bhava or ecstacy can be attained in 2 ways: 1. Constant association with pure devotees
    2. By special and causeless mercy of Krishna or pure devotees (rare)*
5. *By the mercy of Narada muni, Prahlada Maharaj* could take advantage of his instructions by his special blessings 
    and wishes that the child should *become a pure devotee*. But generally, one should execute sadhana 
    (devotional service) very rigidly so that it can elevate us gradually.
6. If the natural symptoms of bhakti are not appearing, then we should understand that we are disobeying 
    the instructions and not following the acharyas properly. Such a heart is called as steel-framed otherwise our 
    heart would be drenched in the love of Krishna.
7. We should meticulously avoid all the 10 offenses while Chanting the holy names of the Lord.
8. Symptoms are simply imitated by sahajiyas. Such willful imitating people have stone hearted and they have not even
    given up the forbidden habits. *Steel-framed heart means the practice of bhakti is not culminating into significant 
    changes in your thoughts, behaviour and actions.*
9. Mind is continuously thinking of Lording over. This should be changed to constantly engage in the loving devotional
    service of the Lord.
10. Meeting of Ramananda Raya and Chaitanya Mahaprabhu. Chaitanya Mahaprabhu also talks about this in Rupa shiksha.
    The seed of transcendental emotions. (bhavankura) The following 9 symptoms should manifest in activities: 
    1. *Shantih* (perseverant/reserved/undisturbed) 
    2. *Avyakta Kalatvam* (Utilization of time engaged in 
        devotional services only. not wasting in other engagements Nectar of Devotion Chapter 18) 
    3. *Viraktih* (Detachment - not engaging any kind of sense enjoyment/sense are not attracted/not artificially 
        staying away. but even in the presence of allurements, not attracted to personal sense enjoyment 
        -real test is agitation of mind) 
    4. *Manashunyata* (Pridelessness - Inspite of possessing all good qualitites and the power that comes with that, 
        one should be prideless knowing that it is all Krishna's mercy. e.g. Bhagirath Maharaj - 
        even being ready to be insulted for the sake of Krishna) 
    5. *Ashabandha* (Great hope - Because I'm nicely practicing sadhana and devotional service, 
        I'm sure I'll go back home back to GodHead.)
    6. *Samutkantha* (Having great eagerness to achieve success in devotional service. It is the only price that we 
        need to pay to get love of God.) 
    7. *Nama Gane sada ruchih* (Great attachment to the holy names of the Lord)
    8. *Asakti* (Great attachment in singing the glories of Lord)
    9. *Preetis tad vasati sthale* (Great attachment to the Holy Dham of Lord)
