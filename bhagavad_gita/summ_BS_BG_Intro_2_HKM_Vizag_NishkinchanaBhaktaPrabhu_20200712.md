*05:40* BG 1.1 - Dhritarashtra's enquiry. Sanjaya's blessing. 
*08:15* What is the principle behind Dhritarashtra's enquiry as explained by the Acharyas?
*11:50* Explanation of the word: Dharmakshetre. 1. Lord Krishna is personally present. 
        (devasthanam - the place where Lord resides) 2. Devotees (from all over the places, even demigods) 
        used to come and perform religious rituals in Kurukshetra. 
*14:00* Why is Dhritarashtra doubtful about his sons' victory? Duryodhana was not a pious or righteous person. 
        And sacred places favor righteous persons like Pandavas. 
        Did they compromise the battle and joined hands due to influence of the place?
*16:00* Example of person hungry, orders food, what will he do? eat, isn't it? Then why the redundant question?
*17:20* Dhritarashtra was confident of Duryodhana winning because of the count 100 v/s 5. But due to influence of place, did he forfeit?
*19:00* Reading further the purport.

*22:40* Story by Srila Prabhupada about a notorious boy who becomes a judge - lesson on jealousy (matsarta).
*25:25* Jealousy - Taking away from a person what rightfully belongs to some other person.
*26:10* Qualities of real leader - should not be jealous. Favoring some people and dismissing others.
*28:50* Krishna wanted to establish Yudhishtira as the King because he was a person of justice. e.g. removing weeds before farming.
*30:55* Reading further the purport.

*36:20* Why Dronacharya chooses to fight on Duryodhana's side? - Obligation
*37:40* Management tips.
*39:20* Duryodhana shocked by military arrangement of Pandavas.
*40:30* Reading BG 1.3
*42:00* Story of the connection between Dronacharya, Dhrupada and Dhrishtadyumna.
        Crux is Dhrishtadyumna was born to kill Dronacharya and still Dronacharya becomes the teacher for him.
*47:50* Duryodhana is pointing mistakes of Dronacharya.
*50:25* Sanjaya answers Dhritarashtra's this question of BG 1.1. in the BG 18.78 that 
        Wherever there is Krishna and Arjuna, victory will be on that side.
