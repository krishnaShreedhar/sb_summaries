*03:20* The division of contents of Bhagavad-gita.
*04:30* Chapter 1 sets the context for the further discussion in Bhagavad-gita. 
        All Chapters and every word in Bhagavad-gita is very very important.

*08:15* What is the principle behind Dhritarashtra's enquiry as explained by the Acharyas?
*11:50* Explanation of the word: Dharmakshetre. 1. Lord Krishna is personally present. 
        (devasthanam - the place where Lord resides) 2. Devotees (from all over the places, even demigods) 
        used to come and perform religious rituals in Kurukshetra. 
*14:00* Why is Dhritarashtra doubtful about his sons' victory? Duryodhana was not a pious or righteous person. 
        And sacred places favor righteous persons like Pandavas. 
        Did they compromise the battle and joined hands due to influence of the place?
*16:00* Example of person hungry, orders food, what will he do? eat, isn't it? Then why the redundant question?
*17:20* Dhritarashtra was confident of Duryodhana winning because of the count 100 v/s 5. 
        But due to influence of place, did he forfeit?

*26:10* Qualities of real leader - should not be jealous. Favoring some people and dismissing others.
*28:50* Krishna wanted to establish Yudhishtira as the King because he was a person of justice. e.g. removing weeds before farming.
*30:55* Reading further the purport.
